Description: Usability wrapper around snow for easier development of
    parallel R programs. This package offers e.g. extended error
    checks, and additional functions. All functions work in sequential
    mode, too, if no cluster is present or wished. Package is also
    designed as connector to the cluster management tool sfCluster, but
    can also used without it.
Depends: R (>= 2.10), snow
